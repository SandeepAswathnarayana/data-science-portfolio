1. Graphics
2. Icons
3. Symbols
4. Text boxes
5. Tables
6. Graphs
7. Underlines

- Don’t forget that once the resume has passed formatting inspection, it is then looking for KEYWORDS relevant to the job description. You can copy/paste the job description into **[TagCrowd](https://tagcrowd.com/)** to identify these.  
- Optimize your resume keywords using **[Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/)**. ATS Software and resume checker to surface candidates that best match the position and job description.
