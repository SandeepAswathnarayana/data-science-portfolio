I have read/watched quite a few noteworthy blogs/videos on building data science skills and portfolio including the ones listed in this post for the most part. Nevertheless, this post by @GalarnykMichael is a comprehensive list that includes sources, inputs, dos and don'ts, suggestions by various data science professionals (data science managers, data scientists, social media icons, or some combination thereof) and others talk about what to have in a portfolio by find something that you love or a problem you want to solve and use your knowledge to do it.
